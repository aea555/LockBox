# LockBox

Lockbox is a secure offline password storage app developed with React Native, Typescript and Expo.  **WIP**. 

# Planned Improvements

- Adding broader localization support.
	> The app currently has localization support for only Turkish, English and German.

- Adding proper data importation and exportation.
	> It is very impractical to safely implement data importation and exportation while keeping the app fully offline. Some **Online** features need to be added to allow the aforementioned actions.
	
- Improving UI reactiveness.
	> Some parts of the UI are not very informative about the results of actions taking place.
